subtitle: University of Porto (FCUP) - CTF Team
---

xSTF (Extreme Security Task Force) was created as a CTF team in 2015 at [Departamento de Ciência de Computadores da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/uni_geral.unidade_view?pv_unidade=89) (DCC-FCUP). Most members are computer science, mathematics or infosec students from the University, we also count with the help of some professors, like our team captain [0xacb](https://pwning.re/). We play CTFs regularly and we've hit the top 100 on [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/15341) several times, our dream goal is top 10 :)
