subtitle: University of Porto - CTF Team
---

xSTF (Extreme Security Task Force) was created as a CTF team in 2015 at [Departamento de Ciência de Computadores da Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/uni_geral.unidade_view?pv_unidade=89) (DCC-FCUP). Most members are computer science, informatics and infosec students from the University of Porto, we also count with the help of some professors. We play CTFs regularly and we've hit the top 100 on [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/15341) several times, our dream goal is top 10 :)
